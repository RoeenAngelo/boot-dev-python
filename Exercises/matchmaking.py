# Matchmaking Queue
# In LockedIn, users that are founding companies can join a matchmaking queue to find potential co-founders for their projects. We'll use the Queue class we've built to manage the matchmaking process.

# Notice the search_and_remove method on the Queue class (in queue.py). It breaks the rules of a traditional queue data structure but will be useful in solving this real-world problem.

# It's okay to violate academic constraints as software engineers as long as we understand the trade-offs involved.

# Assignment
# Complete the matchmake function that simulates users joining and leaving the matchmaking queue. The function should take a queue instance and a user tuple containing a name and action (either "join" or "leave"):

# user = ('Bob', 'join')
# user = ('Alice', 'leave')

# For each call to matchmake:

# If the action is "leave", search the queue for the user and remove them if they are in the queue.
# If the action is "join", push the user's name onto the queue.
# Lastly, check if the queue has at least 4 users in it. If so, pop the first 2 users from the queue and return the following string:
# "{user1} matched {user2}!"

# Where user1 is the first user popped and user2 is the second user popped.

# If there were less than 4 users in the queue, return the following string: "No match found"

    return "No match found"
